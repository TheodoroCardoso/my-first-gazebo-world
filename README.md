First Project - My Gazebo World - Robotics Software Engineer Nanodegree @Udacity

This Gazebo world design intends to replicate the **WorldSkills Mobile Robotics** next challange in a simplified version.

Please take a look on a brief competition explanation below.

## WorldSkills
[WorldSkills](https://worldskills.org/) Is the world's largest TVET competition that happens every 2 years in a different country.

Last event was in Kazan, Russia and had over 60 different skills from bakery to hairdressing to mobile robotics.

The next edition which will take place in Shanghai, China 2022.

## Mobile Robotics
I was a competitor back in 2017 WorldSkills Abu Dhabi and now I'm a mobile robotics mentor learning ROS.

The competition is based on a [robotics kit](https://www.studica.co/worldskills-shanghai-2022) to level the playing field between different countries.

In previous years LabVIEW was the mandatory, for the next edition the hardware has changed and more options like ROS are available.

## The Robot's Task
The WS Shanghai 2022 challange simulates a hospital.

In the actual compeition teams will develop mobile robots that have to carry medicines and hazardous materials represented by colored cubes and gurneys represented by a four wheeled chassis.

More information can be found in the Test Project available as pdf in this repo.


##### PS: I'm new to Git, GitHub, Linux and also ROS. Please let me know how to improve!
